module.exports = "test-file-stub";
// This is a mock file for Jest to handle file imports in tests.
// It returns a string that represents the file, which can be used in tests.
// This is useful for testing components that import images, styles, or other files.
// Jest will use this mock whenever a file import is encountered in the tests.
// This allows you to avoid errors related to file imports in your tests.
// You can customize this mock to return different values if needed.
// For example, you can return a specific image URL or a different string.
// This mock is used in conjunction with the Jest configuration to handle file imports.
